# Rules of well-arranged code writing #
1. Use full function/variable names ie. "PlayerControls", not "PlrCon".

2. Use proper formatting, more about that in the _later section_.

3. Use comments whenever it’s necessary for understanding the code.

4. Each sub-module of the game, should have it’s source code stored in a separated file.

5. Any github commit should have a proper description, i.e. - “fix for a bug causing character to freeze when all arrows are pressed”.

6. ???

7. PROFIT  

# Later section #
Make spaces between the special characters (with an exceptions for parenthesis and semicolon), also when using block of code, place opening and closing brackets (“{“, “}”) in the separate lines, i.e.  

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
    //some.code
    }
